# Here are explained the configurations of CircleTP.

# ================= CIRCLETP DEFAULT CONFIG =================

center:             # defines the coordinates of the central point if you want teleportation to be absolute
    x: 0            # defines the x coordinate of the central point
    z: 0            # defines the z coordinate of the central point
    world: world    # defines the world in which the central point is located
minRadius: 10       # defines the minimum radius. Players will be teleported outside this radius
maxRadius: 20       # defines the maximum radius. Players will be teleported inside this radius, except if 0, which means that there is no maximum radius
forceHeight: -1     # defines wether the players are teleported to the highest block of the random destination (=-1) or to a fixed height (>-1)
relativeTP: true    # defines wether the players are teleported to a point relative to their initial position or to a point relative to the coordinates defined above as center (absolute teleportation)
tell: false         # if a player is teleported by another player, should the teleported player know who teleported him (=true) or not (=false)?
